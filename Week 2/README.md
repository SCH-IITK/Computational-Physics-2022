# Week 2
After getting a basic understanding of python and learning about its two major libraries, numpy and matplotlib, lets move further with our project. This week we understand basic mathemathics and numerical methods in computing.

## Differentiation
For most of the problems in physics we need to calculate derivatives of functions. And many times it is difficult and inefficient to calculate analytical form of the derivative. So we employ numerical derivatives as approximations for calculation purposes. `differentiation.ipynb` lists some of methods used to calculate derivatives of such functions.

## Integration
Just as differentiation, finding the integral of functions is often encountered in physics. Quite often evaluation such integrals might we very difficult and sometimes an analytical solution might not even exist. In `Integration.ipynb` we go through different numerical techniques to evaluate such integrals. 

## Root solving
Many times we encounter problems in which we have to find the root of a function. We have a few algorithms and methods to numerically find roots of a function. These algorithms generally start with a guess of the root and use some iterative method to get better guesses, however we might not always get better guesses. The methods discussed are
- Bisection method
- Newton-Raphson method
- Secant method

Go through the `root finding.ipynb` file which covers this topic.

## Assignments
You will find different questions in the each of the files based on what all was covered. Submit the assignment by making a pull request.
