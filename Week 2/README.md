# Week 2
After getting a basic understanding of python and learning about its two major libraries, numpy and matplotlib, lets move further with our project. This week we understand basic mathemathics and numerical methods in computing.

## Root solving
Many times we encounter problems in which we have to find the root of a function. We have a few algorithms and methods to numerically find roots of a function. These algorithms generally start with a guess of the root and use some iterative method to get better guesses, however we might not always get better guesses. The methods discussed are
- Bisection method
- Newton-Raphson method
- Secant method

Go through the `root solving.ipynb` file which covers this topic.
