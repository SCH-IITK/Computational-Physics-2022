1. SciPy
2. Fourier transforms

## SciPy
SciPy is a highly useful python library containing many functions for scientific computation and analysis. We would be learning how integrate functions, solve ODEs, find roots using the built in functions as well as learn about interpolation and curve fitting which are highly useful which analysing experimental data. We then put curve fitting to practice by analysing experimental data to find refractive index of a material using Fresnel's equations, and to verify Malus' law.

## Fourier transforms
Fourier transform is a mathematical technique which is used quite often in physics. It basically transforms a function of a variable to a function of the inverse variable. In simpler words, it can take a function of time and transform it into a function of frequency. Basically it means that it can decompose any function of time into frequencies, so that if we combine waves of those frequencies we will get the original function of time. You can refer to these amazing resources which explain Fourier transforms from the very basic.

Fourier transforms are very useful in physics and keep popping up everywhere. The far field diffraction pattern obtained by light incident on an aperture is the fourier transform of the aperture shape! Quite interesting! It is also used very much in quantum mechanics. Any wavefunction of a particle in position space is the fourier transform of the wavefunction in momentum space!
