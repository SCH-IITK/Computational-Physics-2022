## Ordinary Differential Equations


## Image handling
In this module we learn how to represent images from physical data, and also how to read data from image of an experiment, and how to analyse the data. We also go slightly off-topic and have fun by exploring different colors, basic image processing like image layering and stacking, increasing image contrast and sharpness.

## Assignment
In this week's assignment,
- we learn how to calculate the displacement as function of time, given velocities at discrete points, using the trapezoidal rule.
- we find the values of various bound states for a quantum square well potential by solving the transcedental equations.
- learn about Scanning tunneling microscope (STM), and using data from STM we generate 2D and 3D images of silicon surface.
