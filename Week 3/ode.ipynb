    "The most popular and stable general technique of solving ODE’s is a set of methods known as “Runge-Kutta” methods. Of these family of methods the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (rk4) is proven to be robust and capable of industrial strength work. The algorithm is based upon the formal integral of the\n",

The critical idea here is to expand the integrand around the midpoint of the integration interval and thereby obtain fourth-order error precision via the cancellation of the $h$ and $h^3$ terms. "
