So, after learning all the various computational methods and techniques, and python functions and libraries, along with the various little implementations of it in physics,
we present the final project. The final project consists of the following problems in which you will put to use whatever you learnt in the project as well as your general
physics understanding. These questions would also help you observe and learn new physical systems and phenomena, some of which might have been very hard for you 
to understand on paper, and hence the need for these computational methods!
- Real pendulum
- Effect of solar wind on satellite motion
- Schrodinger equation

Hope you liked the project and learned new and interesting things.

All the best!
